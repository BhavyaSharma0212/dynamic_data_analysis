Implemented a time-based analysis of Total Deposits, allowing stakeholders to understand deposit trends over specified time frames.

Client-Centric Insights:
Developed custom visualizations to depict Total Loans and Deposits by Client Name and Risk Weighting, offering a granular view of client-specific financial profiles.
Created intuitive charts displaying Total Deposit and Total Loans categorized by Client Age, facilitating age-based financial trend analysis for more informed decision-making.
